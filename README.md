# Mining-Wikipedia-Concept-Prerequisites-Related-Codes-and-Data

This file contains two parts, the experimental code and data used. The data are from Talukdar and Cohen. 2012, whose article is "Crowdsourced Comprehension: Predicting Prerequisite Structure in Wikipedia". All of this is what happened in the process of studying the prerequisite relations among concepts based on Wikipedia. If you have any questions, you can contact me by e-mail (see my GitHub home page) or my instructor, Dr. Xiao (e-mail:xiaokui1024@hotmail.com).
